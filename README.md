# Obstacle-Detection-and-Brake-Command-Application
This project endeavors to establish a robust deep learning framework incorporating both YOLOv8 and MiDAS methodologies to precisely identify obstacles and enact brake commands. The algorithm demonstrates proficient obstacle detection capabilities alongside the execution of brake commands. Furthermore, this codebase can be adapted to interface with Drive By Wire Systems in autonomous vehicles. Notably, a Basler Camera is employed within this context, although the codebase can be seamlessly adjusted to accommodate other camera models. In this particular implementation, the brake command is triggered when an obstacle is detected within a distance of 7.4 meters.
